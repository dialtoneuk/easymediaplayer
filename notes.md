## Things To Do

* Musgle.com API
    - Basically, default to musgle.com instead of youtube.com and add a very
    secure direct.mp3 thingy somehow.
* Change player to support new types
* !Play argument url parsing so can just put direct link to media
* table additions inside setting box - so can add new custom tips inside settings panel
* implement a changelog
* implement inverse position + options as default setting inside CL panel base
* More admin fuctionality
    - Remove all a users videos?
    - Ban a user from posting?
    - Report a users submission?
    - Move a video up and down in position
* (CHECK THIS IS DONE) Basically for some arrangements player also needs to have various modes
    - player_show_constantly - no matter what
    - player_show_in_context - only in context menu
    - player_show_in_scoreboard - only in scoreboard menu
    - player_show_video - when new video plays
* Go through issues.md
* (MAYBE) Error Log Viewer + Server Log Viewer for admins only
* (MAYBE) Clean up all code and document all code, if you don't understand it try and figure it out

## Musgle

Admins can set the player to default to http://musgle.com/ and users can submit direct links of only .mp3s from musgle directly.
