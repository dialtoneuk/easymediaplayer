## Things To Do

* Musgle.com API
    - Basically, default to musgle.com instead of youtube.com and add a very
    secure direct.mp3 thingy somehow.
* Change player to support new types
* Declutter the chatbox various and maybe move some things to a new tool tip kinda mechanism, basically cut down on the things which are duplicating
